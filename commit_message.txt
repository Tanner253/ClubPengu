feat: Terminology standardization, dog refactoring, and wizard hat promo system

## Overview
This commit completes semantic refactoring and implements a promo code system for the
wizard hat cosmetic. Changes standardize terminology from "Character" to "Player" for
the in-game entity, refactor "Doginal" to "Dog", and remove automatic wizard hat
assignment in favor of a promo code unlock system.

## 🔄 Terminology Standardization: Character → Player

### Rationale
- "Player" = the in-game entity (what you're playing as)
- "Character Type" = the classification/species (penguin, dog, frog)
- This aligns with standard game development terminology

### Changes
- `buildCharacterMesh` → `buildPlayerMesh`
- `createCharacterBuilder` → `createPlayerBuilder`
- `characterBuilder` → `playerBuilder`
- `characterGroupRef` → `playerGroupRef`
- `buildCharacter()` → `buildPlayer()`
- Updated all function signatures, variable names, and comments
- Maintained backward compatibility with alias exports

### Files Updated
- `waddlebet/src/engine/PlayerBuilder.js` - Main builder function renamed
- `waddlebet/src/engine/index.js` - Export aliases updated
- `waddlebet/src/VoxelWorld.jsx` - All references updated
- `waddlebet/src/components/PlayerPreview3D.jsx` - Function and ref names
- `waddlebet/src/components/PlayerCreatorOverlay.jsx` - Ref names
- `waddlebet/src/systems/MultiplayerSync.js` - Callback names
- `waddlebet/src/systems/AIManager.js` - Function parameters
- All minigames (P2PUno, P2PMonopoly, P2PBlackjack, P2PBattleship)
- `waddlebet/src/components/CasinoBlackjack.jsx`

## 🐕 Doginal → Dog Refactoring

### Changes
- Character registry key: `'doginal'` → `'dog'`
- Character name: `'Doginal'` → `'Dog'`
- Promo code: `'DOGINAL'` → `'DOG'`
- Generator references: `DoginalGenerators` → `DogGenerators`
- Palette references: `DOGINAL_PALETTE` → `DOG_PALETTE`
- Updated comments and descriptions

### Files Updated
- `waddlebet/src/characters/index.js` - Character registration
- `waddlebet/server/scripts/setupPromoCodes.js` - Promo code definition
- `waddlebet/server/db/models/User.js` - Comment updates
- `waddlebet/src/characters/DogCharacter.js` - File already renamed

### Rationale
- Simplifies terminology (just "dog" not "doginal")
- Matches User model enum which already uses `'dog'`
- More intuitive for users and developers

## 🧙 Wizard Hat Promo Code System

### Problem
Previously, all dogs automatically received a wizard hat, which:
- Limited customization options
- Made the wizard hat less special
- Didn't allow for promo code gating

### Solution
- Removed automatic wizard hat assignment for all dogs
- Created new promo code "WZRDOG" that unlocks wizard hat cosmetic
- Updated "DOG" promo code to only unlock dog character (no hat)
- Wizard hat now only appears if user has it unlocked and equipped

### Changes

#### Promo Codes (`waddlebet/server/scripts/setupPromoCodes.js`)
- **"DOG" code**: Now only unlocks dog character type (no cosmetics)
- **"WZRDOG" code**: New code that unlocks wizard hat cosmetic
  - Can be used by any user who has dog character unlocked
  - Unlocks only the wizard hat, not the character

#### Removed Automatic Assignment
- `PlayerBuilder.js`: Dogs now only get wizard hat if `data.hat === 'wizardHat'`
- `VoxelPlayerDesigner.jsx`: Checks if hat is equipped instead of auto-adding
- `PlayerCreatorOverlay.jsx`: Checks if hat is equipped instead of auto-adding
- `VoxelWorld.jsx`: Wizard hat trail only triggers for equipped wizard hat

#### Updated Logic
- Character type change handler: Removed auto-setting hat to 'none' for dogs
- Wizard hat trail: Only triggers for `hat === 'wizardHat'`, not all dogs
- Character description: Removed "with a wizard hat" text

### Files Updated
- `waddlebet/server/scripts/setupPromoCodes.js` - New WZRDOG code
- `waddlebet/src/engine/PlayerBuilder.js` - Conditional hat rendering
- `waddlebet/src/VoxelPlayerDesigner.jsx` - Conditional hat rendering
- `waddlebet/src/components/PlayerCreatorOverlay.jsx` - Conditional hat rendering
- `waddlebet/src/VoxelWorld.jsx` - Wizard trail logic
- `waddlebet/src/characters/index.js` - Updated description

## 📊 Impact

### Code Quality
- ✅ Consistent terminology throughout codebase
- ✅ Clearer semantic meaning (Player vs Character Type)
- ✅ More maintainable code structure
- ✅ Better alignment with game development standards

### User Experience
- ✅ Wizard hat is now a special unlock via WZRDOG code
- ✅ Dogs can customize their appearance more freely
- ✅ Promo code system allows for marketing campaigns
- ✅ More exclusive feel for wizard hat cosmetic

### Developer Experience
- ✅ Standardized naming makes code easier to understand
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained via aliases
- ✅ Clear separation between entity (Player) and type (Character Type)

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain backward compatibility:
- `createCharacterBuilder` still works (alias to `createPlayerBuilder`)
- `createPenguinBuilder` still works (alias to `createPlayerBuilder`)
- Existing code using old names continues to function
- Database schema unchanged (characterType enum already had 'dog')

## 📝 Testing Notes

- All existing functionality preserved
- Wizard hat only appears when unlocked and equipped
- Dog character works without wizard hat
- Promo code system properly unlocks cosmetics
- Wizard hat trail effects work correctly

## 🎯 Next Steps

- Test WZRDOG promo code redemption
- Verify wizard hat appears only for users with code
- Confirm dog character works without wizard hat
- Update marketing materials with new promo code

---

This commit completes the semantic refactoring and implements a more flexible
cosmetic unlock system. The wizard hat is now a special reward that must be
unlocked via promo code, making it more exclusive and valuable.
